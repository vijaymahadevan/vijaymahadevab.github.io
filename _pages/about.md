I'm a Sr. Applied Science Manager at [Amazon AWS AI](https://www.amazon.science/author/joseph-tighe) working in Computer Vision. My interests include detection, video understanding, tracking and self-supervised learning. 
I was part of the team that launched [Rekogntion Video](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?trkCampaign=acq_paid_search_brand&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=Google&sc_category=Machine%20Learning&sc_country=US&sc_geo=NAMER&sc_outcome=acq&sc_detail=amazon%20image%20recognition&sc_content={adgroup}&sc_matchtype=e&sc_segment=531871356629&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|SU|Machine%20Learning|Solution|US|EN|Sitelink&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!531871356629!e!!g!!amazon%20image%20recognition&ef_id=CjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXONpL2V-1pMjqPxK9qFnAeId2KPIE4IB1Wl2dk-RYmxGzPwxfD34DeBoCbJMQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!531871356629!e!!g!!amazon%20image%20recognition&blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc).
Before I came to AWS I was part of the team that launched [Amazon GO](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011). 
Before that I got my PhD under the supervision of [Svetlana Lazebnik](https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/) at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) with a focus on non-parametric methods for semantic segmentation.
